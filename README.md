# Anki Card Style

## What is this?

This is a code base for a consistent `Anki Card Style`. It makes your anki cards look better and cleaner.

## How to use it?

Note that this is not an extension, so you will have to copy the code from here into your anki card code. This is the case since it provides lots of costumization and it is not possible to transform old cards into cards with this new stlye (at least not at the time with my resources).
